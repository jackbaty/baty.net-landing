I was a partner at Fusionary Media from 1995 until we sold the company in May of 2020. I stayed on in a consulting role and helped transition things to the new ownership through March, 2021. I'm now spending time figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.

Baty.net is currently acting as a hub for the rest of the places I hang out online.

I blog mostly at **[copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com)**, where I write about photography, blogging, analog tools, productivity, software, you name it. You're welcome to visit **[the baty.net archives](https://archive.baty.net)** as well. There are 20 years of posts buried there.

I take notes, daily, in public, using TiddlyWiki at **[Rudimentarylathe.wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki)**.

You can email me at **[jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net)** ✉️. I still enjoy receiving email!

I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera collecting.” I
shoot both film and digital and upload to **[Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty)**.

**Analog**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and fountain pens.

See the **[Now page](/now)** for a list of more specific projects and things I'm into right now.

**Do not expect consistency**.
