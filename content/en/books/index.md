# Books I've Read

This is a list of the books that I have read. I'm sure I've missed or forgotten
many from before I began tracking them. I didn't record the dates until 2010. Books logged before then use
1999-01-01 as the date.

I also try to keep my [Goodreads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259384-jack-baty) up to date.<br><br>
